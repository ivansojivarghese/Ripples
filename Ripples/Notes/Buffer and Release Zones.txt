A release zone is the point where all cW waves are visible. 

The area between these 2 zones, divided by the no. of cW waves = indiv. percentile markers (relative to gW wave, per live height tracking) for indiv. cW waves to show up


A faster click means faster (ripple) wave speed. Hence, a reduced buffer zone and increased release zone. This is to allow more space for higher speed waves to show radiating (fading out) effect.
