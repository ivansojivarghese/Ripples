# Ripples
A wonder of nature recreated in browser fashion...

Physics:
When object is dropped in calm water, 2 types of waves are formed:
- capillary
- gravity

Capillary waves are the first to form out. These create a dense wave grouping of waves know as the Leading Edge when the ripple radiates out. 
Gravity are larger and (appear) slower than capillary. They are not created in heavy quantities as capillary waves. 


Buffer zone:
- A buffer zone is the area (within a radiating gW wave (first)) where no cW waves are visible (but they are still radiating along with gW wave at this point).

Release zone:
- A release zone is the point where all cW waves are visible.
- The area between these 2 zones, divided by the no. of cW waves = indiv. percentile markers (relative to gW wave, per live height tracking) for indiv. cW waves to show up
- A faster click means faster (ripple) wave speed. Hence, a reduced buffer zone and increased release zone. This is to allow more space for higher speed waves to show radiating (fading out) effect.
