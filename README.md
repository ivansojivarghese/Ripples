# Water Ripples Simulation

A wonder of nature recreated in browser fashion...

## Physics of Ripples

When an object is dropped into calm water, two types of waves are formed:

- **Capillary Waves (cW)**: These are the first waves to form, creating a dense grouping known as the **Leading Edge** as the ripple radiates outward.

- **Gravity Waves (gW)**: Larger and seemingly slower than capillary waves, they are generated in smaller quantities.

Capillary waves are the first to form and create a dense grouping known as the Leading Edge as the ripple radiates outward. Gravity waves are larger and appear slower than capillary waves, forming in smaller quantities.

### Buffer Zone

The buffer zone is the area within the first radiating gravity wave where no capillary waves are visible, though they are still propagating alongside the gravity wave.

### Release Zone

The release zone is the point where all capillary waves become visible. The area between the buffer and release zones, divided by the number of capillary waves, forms percentile markers relative to the gravity waveâ€™s live height tracking for individual capillary waves to show up.

Faster clicks generate faster ripple wave speeds, reducing the buffer zone and increasing the release zone.

This allows more space for high-speed waves to display their radiating and fading-out effects.
