Calculations and theories for coefficients (properties) of wave types (refer to 'Physics of Ripples' text document for conceptual understanding):

This document will somewhat outline how the coefficient values were interpreted. 

- WAVELENGTH 
	- Ripple Intensity (rp_i) is a percentile value out of 100.
	- gL_W (wavelength) should be less than half of the rp_i.

- QUANTITY
	- This value should depend on the rp_i and wavelength. However, take note that low (and extremely low) rp_i would not produce high quantity of waves.
	- no. of gS waves are 3 times more than the no. of gL waves.
	- total no. of (gS and gL) waves combined should not exceed the total number of (cS and cL) waves combined. 
	- Waves with larger wavelengths generally don't have much quantity.
	- Finding a relationship between the 2 values - gL_W / gS_W = 1.5

	- cS waves will extend all the way 120% of the ripple potential to form a leading edge (at least visible in the 20% space). 
		- cS_N wil be 20% space (of rp_i) divided by cS_W + (cL_W / cS_W)

	- ESSENTIALLY, each of the wave types may have a different quanitity formula, since cS is meant for the leading edge phenomenon




TRY: wP offset values for qty. calculations. 2 (extended rp_i) - wP = offset. (offset/10) * rp_i

	- (gL_W / gS_W) * 2 = 3; this = (gS_N / gL_N) 
	- Hence, (gL_W / gS_W) * 2 = (gS_N / gL_N)
	- So, (gL_W / cL_W) * 2 = (cL_N / gL_N)												gL_W = .45; gS_W = .3; cL_W = .1; cS_W = .03
	- So, (gL_W / cS_W) * 2 = (cS_N / gL_N)		


	- gS_N is 3 times of gL_N
	- cL_N is 9 times of gL_N
	- cS_N is 30 times of gL_N
